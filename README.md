# NLP Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

This repository contains the full implementation notebook for an **NLP Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** project developed by **Ricardo RodrÃ­guez**.  
The project demonstrates how to combine **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval** techniques to build an intelligent question-answering system capable of providing contextually accurate responses based on external documents.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The project explores how **retrieval-augmented generation** can improve the accuracy and relevance of language model outputs by grounding them in real, retrieved information.

**Key Features:**
- Text preprocessing and embedding generation  
- Document vectorization and similarity search using FAISS  
- Integration of a language model to generate grounded responses  
- Evaluation of generated answers for factual accuracy and fluency

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangChain** for retrieval and orchestration  
- **FAISS / Chroma** for vector storage and search  
- **OpenAI API** for language generation  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation and documentation
