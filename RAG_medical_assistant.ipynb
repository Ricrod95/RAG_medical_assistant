            "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The body's response to an infection, often bacterial, triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses that can lead to organ dysfunction or failure (septic shock). Severe sepsis and septic shock are the most extreme manifestations of sepsis.\n",

            "2. Common Causes and Risk Factors:\n",
            "Common causes include bacterial infections from various sources such as respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, or surgical sites. Risk factors include advanced age, chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes, cancer), weakened immune system, intravascular devices, and recent surgery.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Signs and Symptoms:\n",
            "Early signs may include fever, chills, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, and increased white blood cell count. Severe sepsis can present with decreased urine output, altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and hypotension (low blood pressure). Red-flag symptoms requiring immediate intervention include severe respiratory distress, cardiovascular instability, and signs of organ failure.\n",

            "Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and laboratory findings such as elevated white blood cell count, lactic acid levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures are essential to identify the causative pathogen. Imaging studies may be used to locate the source of infection.\n",

Vasopressors and corticosteroids may be necessary for septic shock. Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) is a protocolized approach to managing sepsis that has been shown to improve outcomes. Surgical intervention may be required if the infection source is not responding to antibiotics or if there is evidence of ongoing infection.\n",

            "Sudden patchy hair loss, also known as alopecia areata, is a common autoimmune disorder that results in the sudden onset of bald spots on the scalp or other areas of the body. The exact cause of this condition is not fully understood, but it's believed to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In some cases, stress or emotional trauma may trigger the onset of alopecia areata.\n",
            "\n",
            "II. Diagnosis\n",
            "\n",
            "The diagnosis of alopecia areata is typically made based on the appearance of the bald patches on the scalp. Your healthcare provider may perform a physical examination and ask about your medical history to rule out other possible causes of hair loss, such as thyroid disorders or nutritional deficiencies. In some cases, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
            "\n",
            "III. Treatment Options\n",
            "\n",
            "A. Topical treatments: Corticosteroids in the form of creams or ointments can be applied directly to the bald patches to help stimulate hair growth. Minoxidil (Rogaine) is another topical treatment that has been shown to promote hair regrowth in some people with alopecia areata.\n",

            "\n",
            "C. Systemic treatments: Oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and other systemic medications may be prescribed in cases of severe alopecia areata or when other treatments have been unsuccessful. These medications can carry significant risks and side effects, so they are typically reserved for more advanced cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "D. Alternative therapies: Some people with alopecia areata find that alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, or stress reduction techniques, help improve their symptoms. However, the evidence supporting these treatments is limited, and they should not be relied upon as a primary treatment approach.\n",

            "\n",
            "A. Manage stress: Chronic stress can contribute to the onset and worsening of alopecia areata. Practicing stress management techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga, may help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being.\n",
            "\n",

However, higher doses of dopamine and norepinephrine pose risks of organ hypoperfusion and acidosis.\n",

From a safety standpoint, the RAG model is the preferred choice, as it delivers accuracy and factual reliability—both critical for the medical domain.\n",
        "- To further improve the relevance and completeness of responses, it is recommended to curate specialized, detail-rich documents for complex or information-heavy sections of the medical diagnosis manual. This will enhance retrieval quality and ensure the model has authoritative material for nuanced medical topics.\n",
        "- While the model performs well on current test queries, coverage could be further enhanced by incorporating a broader range of medical references (e.g., drug formularies, treatment protocols from multiple health organizations, and peer-reviewed studies). This would make the model more robust in handling edge cases and specialized questions.\n",
        "- Although RAG outperformed prompt engineering overall, a hybrid approach could be explored for non-critical, patient-friendly explanations where richer contextualization and softer language may be beneficial. In these cases, prompt tuning on top of RAG output might increase user satisfaction without compromising accuracy.\n",
        "- A slight reduction in precision may occur when queries request step-by-step explanations or list-style outputs. While the model still provides relevant responses, performance improves when these queries are submitted individually without additional secondary questions.\n",
        "- The LLM used in this evaluation has been adapted for lower computing resource requirements. For scenarios where handling larger volumes of information, achieving higher accuracy, or producing richer and more detailed responses is a priority, a larger version of the model is recommended. The runtime and responsiveness will vary depending on the hardware used to submit queries and process responses."
